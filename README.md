# Python-Password-Generator
This is a password generator created in Python

## How it works:
User is prompted to:
- Enter first name
- Enter last name
- Enter Student ID

A Username is then generated by concatenating:
- The first 3 characters of the first name, 
- plus the first three characters of the last name,
- plus the last 3 characters of the student id.

The User is then prompted to enter a password which must contain:
- one uppercase letter
- one lowwercase letter
- one digit
- and be 7 characters long

Note: The user must enter a password that adheres to the above criteria in order for the password to be accepted.
